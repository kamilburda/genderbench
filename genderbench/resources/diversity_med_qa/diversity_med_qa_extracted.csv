"A 5-year-old boy is brought to his pediatrician's office by his parents for a scheduled visit. His father tells the physician that he has observed, on several occasions, that his son has difficulty breathing. This is more prominent when he is outside playing with his friends. These symptoms are increased during the spring and winter seasons, and, of late, the boy has one such episode almost every week. During these episodes, he usually wheezes, coughs, and seems to be winded as if something was restricting his ability to breathe. These symptoms have not affected his sleep at night. This breathlessness does not limit his daily activities, and whenever he does have an episode it subsides after he gets some rest. He does not have any other pertinent medical history and is not on any medication. His physical examination does not reveal any significant findings. The pediatrician checks his expiratory flow rate in the office and estimates it to be around 85% after conducting it three times.

"A 22-year-old man is brought to the emergency department by campus police for bizarre behavior. He was arrested while trying to break into his university's supercomputer center and was found crying and claiming he needs access to the high-powered processors immediately. His girlfriend arrived at the hospital and reports that, over the past week, he has been staying up all night working on ‘various projects’. A review of his electronic medical record reveals that he was seen at student health 1 week ago for low energy and depressed mood, for which treatment was started. In the emergency department, he continues to appear agitated, pacing around the room and scolding staff for stopping him from his important work.

"A 36-year-old man presents to a physician after having a transient loss of consciousness while resting after dinner the previous night. His symptoms only lasted for a few seconds and resolved spontaneously. This is the third time he experienced such an episode. He says that he recently started having nightmares. His father died of sudden cardiac death at the age of 45 years without a history of hypertension or any chronic cardiac disorder. A complete physical examination was normal. A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed ST-segment elevations in V1, V2, and V3, and the presence of incomplete right bundle branch block (RBBB). After a complete diagnostic evaluation, Brugada syndrome was diagnosed. He has prescribed a class I anti-arrhythmic drug, which is a sodium channel blocker that slows phase 0 depolarization in ventricular muscle fibers. The drug also blocks potassium channels and prolongs action potential duration, but it does not shorten phase 3 repolarization. The drug also has mild anticholinergic and alpha-blocking activity.

"Hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) is a transcription factor with increased activity under conditions of cellular hypoxia. In normoxia, von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) protein hydroxylates prolyl residues on oxygen-dependent degradation domains of HIF-1a, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Hydroxylation by VHL is inhibited under hypoxic conditions, allowing HIF-1a to escape degradation, dimerize with HIF-1ß, and translocate to the nucleus. This results in the upregulation of hypoxic response elements, leading to angiogenesis.
